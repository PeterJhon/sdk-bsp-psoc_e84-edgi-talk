/**
 * \addtogroup group_mtb_async_transfer Async Transfer Utility Library
 * \{
 *
 * Async Transfer Utility Library provides an implementation of data transfer
 * functions in which the calling application initiates the data transfer on the
 * desired communication peripheral and then the data transfer happens in the
 * background without the application involvement.
 *
 * This library does not have direct knowledge of the underlying communication
 * peripheral being used and the users of the library shall set up the necessary
 * interface needed to support the background transfer on the specific communication
 * peripheral
 *
 * <b>Features:</b>
 * * Both read and write transfers can be performed.
 * * Transfers can performed via either CPU copy or DMA.
 * * One transfer in each of direction (read and write) can be pending at the same time.
 * * A callback can be invoked on completion of a transfer.
 * * It is possible to query whether an async-transfer instance is available in a given direction.
 * * An in-progress transfer can be aborted.
 * * Repeated transfers can be performed without re-initializing.
 * * Multiple instances of the async transfer library can co-exist, managing different
 * communications interfaces.
 *
 ********************************************************************************
 * \section group_mtb_async_transfer_prerequisites  Prerequisites
 ********************************************************************************
 * Setup the interfaces necessary to communicate to the underlying hardware.
 * \ref  mtb_async_transfer_interface_t.
 *
 * Allocate the memory for the context structure and set-up the underlying
 * communication inteface's using \ref mtb_async_transfer_init
 *
 * For CPU based transfers, the user of async transfer must arrange for
 * \ref mtb_async_transfer_process_fifo_level_event to be invoked,
 * (e.g. by registering an interrupt handler) when FIFO reaches the desired level
 * on the underlying communications interface.
 *
 * For DMA  based transfers, the user of async transfer must arrange for
 * \ref mtb_async_transfer_process_dma_complete to be invoked,
 * (e.g. by registering an interrupt handler) when FIFO reaches the desired level
 * on the underlying communications interface.
 *
 * Set up the callback to be invoked when the async transfer is complete using
 * \ref mtb_async_transfer_register_callback
