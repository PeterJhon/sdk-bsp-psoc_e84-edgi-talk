# Edgi-Talk_M55_LVGL Example Project

[**中文**](./README_zh.md) | **English**

## Introduction

This example is based on the **Edgi-Talk platform**, demonstrating the **LVGL stress demo** running on **RT-Thread real-time operating system**.
It allows users to quickly verify the board-level **LCD display driver** and the **LVGL graphics framework** porting, providing a reference for future GUI application development.

### LVGL Overview

**LVGL** (Light and Versatile Graphics Library) is an open-source embedded GUI development framework designed for resource-constrained devices. It provides modern graphical interfaces with optimized CPU and memory usage, running efficiently on both low-end MCUs and more powerful MPU platforms.

#### Key Features

1. **Lightweight**
   Optimized for minimal memory and CPU usage, ideal for low-power devices and resource-constrained environments.

2. **Cross-platform**
   Runs on multiple operating systems (FreeRTOS, RT-Thread, Zephyr, Linux) or bare-metal platforms. Only requires display and input drivers to be ported.

3. **Rich Widgets**
   Includes buttons, labels, sliders, charts, tables, lists, etc., and allows custom widget extensions.

4. **Advanced Rendering**
   Supports anti-aliasing, transparency, gradients, shadows, rounded corners, and animations for modern UIs.

5. **Input Device Support**
   Supports touchscreens, capacitive touch, mouse, keyboard, encoder, and multi-touch. Events are unified via LVGL’s event system.

6. **Internationalization**
   UTF-8 encoding with support for bidirectional text (e.g., Arabic, Hebrew).

7. **Extensibility**
   Flexible themes, styles, and integration with file systems and image decoders.

#### Applications

LVGL is widely used in:

* Consumer electronics (smart home panels, smartwatches, appliances)
* Industrial HMI and instrumentation
* Automotive displays (central console, passenger screen, instrument cluster)
* Medical devices (portable monitors, handheld instruments)

#### Ecosystem & Community

LVGL is **MIT licensed** and supported by **SquareLine Studio** for GUI design and **LVGL Simulator** for PC-based development. A large community provides open-source widgets, themes, and porting examples.

## Software Description

* Developed on the **Edgi-Talk platform**, running on the **M55 application core**.
* Example features:

  * Initialize LVGL graphics library
  * Run **lv_demo_stress** on the LCD
  * Demonstrate rendering and performance testing
* Code structure is clear for understanding display driver integration and LVGL porting.

## Usage

### Build and Download

1. Open and compile the project.
2. Connect the board USB to the PC using the **onboard debugger (DAP)**.
3. Flash the generated firmware to the board.

### Running Result

* After flashing and powering on, the system automatically runs **lv_demo_stress** on the LCD.
* Users can modify `applications/main.c` to switch to other LVGL demos (e.g., `lv_demo_widgets`, `lv_demo_music`).

## Notes

* To modify the **graphical configuration**, use:

```
tools/device-configurator/device-configurator.exe
libs/TARGET_APP_KIT_PSE84_EVAL_EPC2/config/design.modus
```

* Save and regenerate code after modifications.
* If the screen shows no output, check:

  * LCD connections and power supply
  * `lv_port_disp.c` and `lv_port_indev.c` match the actual hardware

## Startup Sequence

```
+------------------+
|   Secure M33     |
|  (Secure Core)   |
+------------------+
          |
          v
+------------------+
|       M33        |
| (Non-Secure Core)|
+------------------+
          |
          v
+-------------------+
|       M55         |
| (Application Core)|
+-------------------+
```

⚠️ Strictly follow the flashing order to ensure proper system operation.

---

* If the example fails, first flash **Edgi-Talk_M33_S_Template** to ensure proper initialization.
* To enable M55, configure in **M33 project**:

```
RT-Thread Settings --> Hardware --> select SOC Multi Core Mode --> Enable CM55 Core
```
