# Edgi-Talk_Key_Irq Example Project

[**中文**](./README_zh.md) | **English**

## Introduction

This example project is based on the **Edgi-Talk platform**, running on the **RT-Thread real-time operating system**, demonstrating the usage of **Key IRQ (Button Interrupts)**.
Through this project, users can learn how to configure GPIO interrupts in RT-Thread and implement button-triggered event responses, providing a reference for future human-machine interaction applications.

## MCU Interrupt System Overview

Key interrupt features:

1. **NVIC (Nested Vector Interrupt Controller)**

   * Supports **interrupt nesting**: high-priority interrupts can preempt lower-priority ones
   * Supports **priority grouping** (Preemption Priority and Subpriority)
   * IRQn maps to the interrupt vector table, and NVIC calls the corresponding ISR

2. **GPIO External Interrupt (EXTI)**

   * Each GPIO pin can be configured as an external interrupt input
   * Supports **rising edge, falling edge, or both edges trigger**
   * Interrupt channels are managed by the **ICU (Interrupt Controller Unit)**
   * Configurable via Renesas FSP or low-level registers
   * Low response latency, suitable for buttons, sensors, and other event-driven inputs

3. **RT-Thread PIN Driver Model**

   * GPIOs are encapsulated as **PIN devices** in RT-Thread
   * Provides a unified interface:

     * `rt_pin_mode(pin, mode)`: configure input/output mode
     * `rt_pin_read(pin)` / `rt_pin_write(pin, value)`: read/write GPIO
     * `rt_pin_attach_irq(pin, mode, callback, args)`: register interrupt callback
     * `rt_pin_irq_enable(pin, enable)`: enable/disable interrupt

> Using the RT-Thread PIN driver, you can handle interrupts without directly manipulating NVIC or MCU registers.

## Software Description

* Developed on the **Edgi-Talk** platform.
* Uses **RT-Thread** as the OS kernel.
* Example features include:

  * Configure button GPIO as interrupt input
  * Trigger interrupt callback when the button is pressed
  * Blue LED blinks at a 500ms period, indicating normal system operation

## Usage

### Build and Download

1. Open the project and compile it.
2. Connect the board’s USB interface to the PC using the **onboard debugger (DAP)**.
3. Flash the generated firmware to the board using a programming tool.

### Running Result

* After flashing, power on the board to run the example.
* The **blue LED** will blink at a 500ms period, indicating the system scheduler is running.
* When a user presses the button, the interrupt callback is triggered, and the following message is printed to the serial terminal:

```
The button is pressed
```

## Notes

* To modify the **graphical configuration**, open the configuration file using the following tool:

```
tools/device-configurator/device-configurator.exe
libs/TARGET_APP_KIT_PSE84_EVAL_EPC2/config/design.modus
```

* After modification, save the configuration and regenerate the code.

## Startup Sequence

The system starts in the following order:

```
+------------------+
|   Secure M33     |
|  (Secure Core)   |
+------------------+
          |
          v
+------------------+
|       M33        |
| (Non-Secure Core)|
+------------------+
          |
          v
+-------------------+
|       M55         |
| (Application Core)|
+-------------------+
```

⚠️ Please strictly follow the above flashing sequence; otherwise, the system may fail to run properly.

---

* If the example does not run correctly, first compile and flash the **Edgi-Talk_M33_S_Template** project to ensure proper initialization and core startup, then run this example.
* To enable the M55 core, enable the following configuration in the **M33 project**:

```
RT-Thread Settings --> Hardware --> select SOC Multi Core Mode --> Enable CM55 Core
```
