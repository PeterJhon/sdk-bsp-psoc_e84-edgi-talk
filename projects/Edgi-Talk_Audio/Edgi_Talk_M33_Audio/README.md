# Edgi-Talk_Audio Example Project

[**中文**](./README_zh.md) | **English**

## Introduction

This example project is based on the **Edgi-Talk platform** and demonstrates **audio recording and playback** features running on the **RT-Thread real-time operating system**.
Through this project, users can experience microphone audio data acquisition and speaker playback. The playback can be controlled using a button, while the LED indicator reflects the current playback state.

### Audio Overview

Audio devices are an essential component of embedded systems, responsible for audio data sampling and output.
An audio system typically consists of a data bus interface, control bus interface, audio codec (Codec), speaker, and microphone, as shown below:

#### Audio Device Features

The RT-Thread Audio device driver framework forms the low-level foundation of the Audio subsystem. It manages raw audio data input/output, stream control, device management, volume control, and hardware/codec abstraction.

* Interface: Standard device interface (open/close/read/control)
* Supports synchronous access
* Supports both playback and recording
* Supports audio parameter management
* Supports volume control

## Software Description

* The project is developed based on the **Edgi-Talk M33** platform.

* Example features include:

  * Microphone audio data acquisition
  * Audio playback through the speaker
  * Button control for play/stop
  * LED indication for playback status

* The project structure is clear and helps users understand RT-Thread’s audio device driver and event handling mechanisms.

## Usage Instructions

### Compilation and Download

1. Open the project and complete the compilation.
2. Connect the board’s USB port to the PC using the **onboard debugger (DAP)**.
3. Use the programming tool to flash the generated firmware to the development board.

   * The project can automatically call the signing tool (e.g., `tools/edgeprotecttools/bin/edgeprotecttools.exe`) to merge and flash the signed firmware (e.g., `proj_cm33_s_signed.hex`).

### Runtime Behavior

* After flashing, power on the board to run the example.
* The LED turns **on by default**, indicating that audio playback is enabled.
* Press the button to **toggle the playback state**:

  * **Play**: LED on — microphone-captured audio is played through the speaker
  * **Stop**: LED off — audio playback is paused
* The system continuously captures and plays audio data, achieving real-time audio loopback.

## Notes

* To modify the **graphical configuration** of the project, open the configuration file using the following tool:

  ```
  tools/device-configurator/device-configurator.exe
  libs/TARGET_APP_KIT_PSE84_EVAL_EPC2/config/design.modus
  ```
* After editing, save the configuration and regenerate the code.

## Boot Sequence

The system boot sequence is as follows:

```
+------------------+
|   Secure M33     |
|   (Secure Core)  |
+------------------+
          |
          v
+------------------+
|       M33        |
| (Non-Secure Core)|
+------------------+
          |
          v
+-------------------+
|       M55         |
| (Application Core)|
+-------------------+
```

⚠️ Please strictly follow the boot sequence above when flashing the firmware, otherwise the system may fail to run properly.

---

* If the example project does not run correctly, compile and flash the **Edgi-Talk_M33_S_Template** project first to ensure proper initialization and core startup sequence before running this example.
* To enable the M55 core, configure the **M33 project** as follows:

  ```
  RT-Thread Settings --> Hardware --> select SOC Multi Core Mode --> Enable CM55 Core
  ```
