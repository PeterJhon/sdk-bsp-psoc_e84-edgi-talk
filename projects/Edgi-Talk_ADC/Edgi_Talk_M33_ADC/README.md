# Edgi-Talk_ADC Example Project

[**中文**](./README_zh.md) | **English**

## Introduction

This example project is based on the **Edgi-Talk platform**, running on the **RT-Thread real-time operating system**, and demonstrates how to use the **ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter)**.
Through this project, users can quickly experience ADC data acquisition and processing, providing a reference for developing analog signal acquisition applications.
During runtime, the blue indicator LED blinks periodically, indicating that the system has started and is running properly.

### 1. Overview of ADC

**ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter)** is a device or module that converts continuous analog signals into discrete digital signals, serving as a core component in modern digital control, signal processing, and measurement systems.

* **Function**: Converts continuous signals such as voltage or current into digital values for processing by a microcontroller (MCU), DSP, or FPGA.
* **Key Specifications**:

  * **Resolution**: The number of bits in the ADC output, representing the number of distinguishable levels. Edgi uses **12-bit** resolution, i.e., 2^12 = 4096 levels.
  * **Sampling Rate**: The number of samples the ADC takes per second, determining the range of detectable signal frequencies.
  * **Input Range**: The range of analog voltages the ADC can handle.
  * **Accuracy**: Indicates how closely the ADC output matches the actual input signal, affected by noise, nonlinearity, and offset errors.

### 2. ADC Working Principle

ADC operation typically involves the following stages:

1. **Sampling and Holding (Sample & Hold, S/H)**

   * Captures the analog signal at a specific moment and holds it steady to ensure stability during conversion.
2. **Quantization**

   * Divides the analog signal into discrete levels, each corresponding to a digital code.
   * A 12-bit ADC divides the input voltage range into 4096 levels, with quantization precision expressed as ΔV = VREF / 4096.
3. **Encoding**

   * Converts the quantized level into binary code for output.

## Software Description

* The project is developed based on the **Edgi-Talk** platform.

* Uses **RT-Thread** as the operating system kernel.

* Example features:

  * ADC initialization and sampling
  * LED indicator blinking
  * ADC sampling results printed via serial port

* The project has a clear structure, making it easy for users to understand the ADC driver and RT-Thread threading mechanism.

## Usage Instructions

### Compilation and Download

1. Open the project and complete the compilation.
2. Connect the board’s USB port to the PC using the **onboard debugger (DAP)**.
3. Use the programming tool to flash the generated firmware onto the board.

### Runtime Behavior

* After flashing, power on the board to run the example.
* The **blue indicator LED** blinks every 500 ms, indicating normal system operation.
* ADC samples battery voltage and prints results to the serial port as shown below:

  ```
  Value is: 3.123 V
  Value is: 3.125 V
  ...
  ```

## Notes

* To modify the **graphical configuration** of the project, open the configuration file using the following tool:

  ```
  tools/device-configurator/device-configurator.exe
  libs/TARGET_APP_KIT_PSE84_EVAL_EPC2/config/design.modus
  ```
* After making changes, save the configuration and regenerate the code.

## Boot Sequence

The system boot sequence is as follows:

```
+------------------+
|   Secure M33     |
|   (Secure Core)  |
+------------------+
          |
          v
+------------------+
|       M33        |
| (Non-Secure Core)|
+------------------+
          |
          v
+-------------------+
|       M55         |
| (Application Core)|
+-------------------+
```

⚠️ Please strictly follow the boot sequence above when flashing firmware, or the system may fail to start properly.

---

* If the example project does not run correctly, compile and flash the **Edgi-Talk_M33_S_Template** project first to ensure proper initialization and core startup sequence before running this example.
* To enable the M55 core, configure the **M33 project** as follows:

  ```
  RT-Thread Settings --> Hardware --> select SOC Multi Core Mode --> Enable CM55 Core
  ```
