# Edgi-Talk_M33_HyperRam Example Project

[**中文**](./README_zh.md) | **English**

## Introduction

This example project is based on the **Edgi-Talk platform**, demonstrating the **HyperRam functionality** running on the **RT-Thread real-time operating system**.
Through this project, users can quickly verify HyperRam operation, providing a basic reference for subsequent hardware control and application development.

## Software Description

* The project is developed based on the **Edgi-Talk** platform.

* Example features include:

* The project structure is simple, making it easy to understand HyperRam control logic and hardware driver interfaces.

```c
#include "rtthread.h"

#define DRV_DEBUG
#define LOG_TAG         "drv_hyperam"
#include <drv_log.h>

#define PSRAM_ADDRESS                 (0x64800000)

#ifdef BSP_USING_HYPERAM
#ifdef RT_USING_MEMHEAP_AS_HEAP
    struct rt_memheap system_heap;
#endif

static int hyperam_init(void)
{
    LOG_D("hyperam init success, mapped at 0x%X, size is %d bytes, data width is %d", PSRAM_ADDRESS, BSP_USING_HYPERAM_SIZE, 16);
#ifdef RT_USING_MEMHEAP_AS_HEAP
    /* If RT_USING_MEMHEAP_AS_HEAP is enabled, HYPERAM is initialized to the heap */
    rt_memheap_init(&system_heap, "hyperam", (void *)PSRAM_ADDRESS, BSP_USING_HYPERAM_SIZE);
#endif
    return RT_EOK;
}
INIT_BOARD_EXPORT(hyperam_init);
#endif
```

## Usage

### Build and Download

1. Open the project and compile it.
2. Connect the board’s USB interface to the PC using the **onboard debugger (DAP)**.
3. Use the programming tool to flash the generated firmware to the development board.

### Running Result

* After flashing, power on the board to run the example project.

## Notes

* To modify the **graphical configuration** of the project, open the configuration file using the following tool:

```
tools/device-configurator/device-configurator.exe
libs/TARGET_APP_KIT_PSE84_EVAL_EPC2/config/design.modus
```

* After modification, save the configuration and regenerate the code.

## Startup Sequence

The system starts in the following order:

```
+------------------+
|   Secure M33     |
|  (Secure Core)   |
+------------------+
          |
          v
+------------------+
|       M33        |
| (Non-Secure Core)|
+------------------+
          |
          v
+-------------------+
|       M55         |
| (Application Core)|
+-------------------+
```

⚠️ Please strictly follow the above flashing sequence; otherwise, the system may fail to run properly.

---

* If the example does not run correctly, first compile and flash the **Edgi-Talk_M33_S_Template** project to ensure proper initialization and core startup, then run this example.
* To enable the M55 core, enable the following configuration in the **M33 project**:

```
RT-Thread Settings --> Hardware --> select SOC Multi Core Mode --> Enable CM55 Core
```
