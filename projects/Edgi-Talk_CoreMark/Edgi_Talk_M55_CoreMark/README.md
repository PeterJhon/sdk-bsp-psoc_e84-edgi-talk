# Edgi-Talk_M55_CoreMark Example Project

[**中文**](./README_zh.md) | **English**

## Introduction

This example project is based on the **Edgi-Talk platform**, demonstrating the **CoreMark benchmark running on the M55 core** under the **RT-Thread real-time operating system**.
Through this project, users can quickly verify the performance of the M55 core and understand how the multi-core coprocessor operates under a real-time OS environment.

### About CoreMark

**CoreMark** is a standardized embedded CPU benchmark developed by *EEMBC (Embedded Microprocessor Benchmark Consortium)*.
It is primarily used to measure the **core computational performance** of a microcontroller or processor, independent of specific hardware peripherals.

### Test Contents

CoreMark evaluates CPU performance through four representative algorithm categories:

* **List processing**
* **Matrix operations**
* **State machine**
* **CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check)**

### Test Results

The output is represented as **CoreMark/MHz** or **CoreMark**, which allows performance comparison between different processors or compiler optimization levels.

### Features

* Open source, portable, and lightweight
* Repeatable and verifiable results
* Focused on CPU integer computation capability

## Software Description

* The project is developed based on the **Edgi-Talk** platform.

* The example includes:

  * Running CoreMark benchmark on the M55 core
  * Printing benchmark results through UART

* The project has a clean structure, making it easy to understand the M55 startup process and performance testing method.

## Usage

### Build and Download

1. Open the project and compile it.
2. Connect the board’s USB interface to your PC using the **onboard debugger (DAP)**.
3. Use the programming tool to flash the generated firmware to the development board.

### Running Result

* After flashing, power on the board to start RT-Thread.
* The following serial output indicates the system started successfully:

```
 \ | /
- RT -     Thread Operating System
 / | \     5.0.2 build Sep  5 2025 15:19:27
 2006 - 2022 Copyright by RT-Thread team
msh >Hello RT-Thread
It's cortex-m55
```

* Then, manually enter the following command in the serial terminal:

```
core_mark
```

* The system will start the CoreMark test and print the benchmark results, for example:

```
Benchmark started, please make sure it runs for at least 10s.

## Notes

* To modify the **graphical configuration** of the project, open the configuration file using the following tool:

```
tools/device-configurator/device-configurator.exe
libs/TARGET_APP_KIT_PSE84_EVAL_EPC2/config/design.modus
```

* After modification, save the configuration and regenerate the code.

## Startup Sequence

The system starts in the following order:

```
+------------------+
|   Secure M33     |
|  (Secure Core)   |
+------------------+
          |
          v
+------------------+
|       M33        |
| (Non-Secure Core)|
+------------------+
          |
          v
+-------------------+
|       M55         |
| (Application Core)|
+-------------------+
```

⚠️ Please strictly follow the above flashing sequence; otherwise, the system may fail to run properly.

---

* If the example does not run correctly, first compile and flash the **Edgi-Talk_M33_S_Template** project to ensure proper initialization and core startup, then run this example.
* To enable the M55 core, enable the following configuration in the **M33 project**:

  ```
  RT-Thread Settings --> Hardware --> select SOC Multi Core Mode --> Enable CM55 Core
  ```
