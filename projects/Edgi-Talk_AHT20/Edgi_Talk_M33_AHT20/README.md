# Edgi-Talk_M33_AHT20 Example Project

[**中文**](./README_zh.md) | **English**

## Introduction

This example project is based on the **Edgi-Talk platform** and demonstrates how to drive and use the **AHT20 temperature and humidity sensor**.
Through this project, users can quickly experience AHT20 data acquisition and processing, and view the sampled results via the serial port on the development board.

### AHT10 Software Package Overview

The AHT10 software package provides basic functions for using the AHT10 temperature and humidity sensor, and also includes an optional software-based moving average filter.
For more details, please refer to the README file in the AHT10 software package.

## Software Description

* The project is developed based on the **Edgi-Talk** platform.

* Example functionalities include:

  * AHT20 initialization and communication via I²C
  * Temperature and humidity data acquisition and parsing
  * Displaying sampled data via serial output

* The project has a clear structure, helping users understand I²C driver usage and sensor interfacing.

## Usage Instructions

### Compilation and Download

1. Open the project and complete the compilation.
2. Connect the board’s USB port to the PC using the **onboard debugger (DAP)**.
3. Use the programming tool to flash the generated firmware onto the development board.

### Runtime Behavior

* After flashing, power on the board to run the example project.
* The system will initialize the AHT20 sensor and begin sampling temperature and humidity data.
* The sampled data will be printed via the serial terminal, as shown below:

## Notes

* To modify the **graphical configuration** of the project, open the configuration file using the following tool:

```
tools/device-configurator/device-configurator.exe
libs/TARGET_APP_KIT_PSE84_EVAL_EPC2/config/design.modus
```

* After editing, save the configuration and regenerate the code.

## Boot Sequence

The system boot sequence is as follows:

```
+------------------+
|   Secure M33     |
|   (Secure Core)  |
+------------------+
          |
          v
+------------------+
|       M33        |
| (Non-Secure Core)|
+------------------+
          |
          v
+-------------------+
|       M55         |
| (Application Core)|
+-------------------+
```

⚠️ Please strictly follow the boot sequence above when flashing firmware; otherwise, the system may fail to start properly.

---

* If the example project does not run correctly, compile and flash the **Edgi-Talk_M33_S_Template** project first to ensure proper initialization and core startup sequence before running this example.
* To enable the M55 core, configure the **M33 project** as follows:

  ```
  RT-Thread Settings --> Hardware --> select SOC Multi Core Mode --> Enable CM55 Core
  ```
