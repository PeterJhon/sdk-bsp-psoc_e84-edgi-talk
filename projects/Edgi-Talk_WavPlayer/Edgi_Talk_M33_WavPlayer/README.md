# Edgi-Talk_WavPlayer Example Project

[**中文**](./README_zh.md) | **English**

## Introduction

This example project demonstrates **WAV audio playback** on the **M33 core** with **RT-Thread RTOS**.
It allows users to experience WAV file parsing, playback mechanism, and verify audio decoding and driver interfaces.

## Hardware Overview

## Software Description

* Developed on **Edgi-Talk** platform.

* Example features:

  * WAV file parsing and playback
  * Audio output via onboard DAC or audio peripherals
  * Supports **PCM16** WAV files
  * Sample rates: **16 kHz, 24 kHz, 48 kHz**
  * Stereo output
  * Playback status printed to serial console

* Provides a clear example of **audio playback driver integration with RT-Thread filesystem**.

## Usage

### Build and Download

1. Open and compile the project.
2. Connect the board USB to PC via **DAP**.
3. Flash the compiled firmware.
4. Copy WAV files to SD card or external storage root directory, e.g., `16000.wav`.

### Running Result

* After power-on, the system initializes I2C, I2S audio devices, and mounts storage.
* Start playback via serial terminal:

```
wavplay -s 16000.wav
```

* Sample serial output:

Hello RT-Thread
This core is cortex-m33
msh />wavplay -s 16000.wav
[D/WAV_PLAYER] EVENT:PLAYSTOPPAUSERESUME, STATE:STOPPED -> PLAYING
[D/WAV_PLAYER] open wavplayer, device sound0
[D/WAV_PLAYER] Information:

```

* Playback status, sample rate, channels, and bit width are displayed on the serial console.

### Notes

* WAV files must be **PCM16** format, **16 kHz, 24 kHz, or 48 kHz**, stereo output.
* To modify graphical configuration:

```
tools/device-configurator/device-configurator.exe
libs/TARGET_APP_KIT_PSE84_EVAL_EPC2/config/design.modus
```

* Save changes and regenerate code.
* Ensure storage is properly inserted and mounted, otherwise playback will fail.

## Startup Sequence

```
+------------------+
|   Secure M33     |
|  (Secure Core)   |
+------------------+
          |
          v
+------------------+
|       M33        |
| (Non-Secure Core)|
+------------------+
          |
          v
+-------------------+
|       M55         |
| (Application Core)|

```

⚠️ Flash in this order strictly.

---

* If the example does not run, first compile and flash **Edgi-Talk_M33_S_Template**.
* To enable M55:

```
RT-Thread Settings --> Hardware --> select SOC Multi Core Mode --> Enable CM55 Core
```
